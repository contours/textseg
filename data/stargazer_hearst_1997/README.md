"Stargazer" Manual Segmentations (Hearst, 1997)
===============================================

In the original text, there are 22 paragraphs, but the version presented to coders contained 21 paragraphs, with paragraphs 4 and 5 merged together as one.  The text contained in this distribution reflects this merging.

Note that the original PDF version of the article "[Stargazers look for life](https://github.com/downloads/cfournie/segmentation.corpora/stargazers_look_for_life.pdf)", by Baker (1990) is also available.
